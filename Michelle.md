Notes:

Well done a great looking website! Nice use of bold background images. Well done on getting it live on gh-pages.

Check out [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.asp) for more details on the background image properties to make your site scale nicer on bigger and smaller screens.

It would be a good to see a link back from the portfolio page back to the index page. One way paths are not nice and cause a negative experience when they do happen.

Good work on self reviewing your css file. Use git and github to keep versions. This way you wont have confusion over which file is the latest and have the bulk of spare files hanging around.

Done
Add a title tag to each page. Make them unique. e.g. 'Michelle - Portfolio'.
Add an h1 to each page. It is a little trick for SEO. You can always style it smaller. Only have one h1 though.

done
Alt text for an image should decribe the image. How would you describe the image to someone else, write that. Short and sweet.

I see you have linked the background image from external hosting. I would suggest that you copy the image into your images folder and use that relative url. You never know when the other image might fault.
